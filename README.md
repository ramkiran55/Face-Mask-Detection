# Face-Mask-Detection

During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this tutorial we will develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.

## About the Project
In this project, we have developed a deep learning model for face mask detection using Python, Keras, and OpenCV. We developed the face mask detector model for detecting whether person is wearing a mask or not. We have trained the model using Keras with network architecture. Training the model is the first part of this project and testing using webcam using OpenCV is the second part.

## Dataset
The dataset we are working on consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.
